Fulfillment & Logistics Operations Execution includes roles that manage and execute inventory, warehouse and fulfilment activities (planning and execution, distribution is covered by carrier management). Includes all kinds of warehouses like CFS, CY, inland depot / warehouses, bonded warehouses, etc. whether owned, operated or both by Maersk. Administrative stream includes those who primarily support others by performing skilled technical, administrative or operational tasks. Jobs may range from highly supervised entry-level workers, technicians, and administrative staff to experienced individual contributors with robust technical or practical knowledge in specific areas, who have an ability to execute specialized work to support operations. At the top of this career stream, individuals work independently and apply standards, yet can also make departures from established processes to resolve problems. A colleague at this level works on tasks of limited scope and complexity, exercises independent judgment within defined boundaries and guidelines and typically under supervision. The colleague has skills developed through job-related training and on-the-job experience within a specific job discipline. Colleagues have knowledge of standardized work routines and methods, general facts and information but may need to escalate non-routine problems to a more experienced colleague or supervisor. The job requires limited job and business knowledge at the time of hiring.
